# Eigen
This is a header file to make Eigen work with platform.io projects.

Please see [Eigen's website](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/index.html) for documentation.

## Clone

Since this repository uses git submodules you have to clone it using `git clone --recurse-submodules <url>`. Or just add it to your projects lib folder as a git submodule. Don't forget to run `git submodule update --init --recursive` aftwerwards.

## Setup

Simply include the header file:

```C++
#include <Eigen.h>
```
